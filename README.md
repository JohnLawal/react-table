## React Table

This is a reusable react table component.
Features I plan to support include:

### `Column sorting`

Users will be able to sort the table by clicking on column headers<br />
The developer will be able to set which columns are sortable.

### `Pagination`

Users will be able to navigate between pages of the data by either clicking on page numbers<br />
or by entering page numbers to navigate to.

### `Dynamic Headers`

The headers of the table will be dynamic [otherwise why is this a resuable component? :) ]<br />

### `Support complex cells`
The table will support cell values that are not just strings but can also be JSX elements.

### `Support Custom Styles`

To be truly reusable, developers will be able to pass in table styles of their own.
